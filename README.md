--------- Minimax algorithm ------------

project as part of CS50 AI course

----------------------------------------

Implemented: all functions in tactactoe.py file

features: uses minimax algorithm to evaluate potential moves on a tic tac toe game board and return the optimal move for the AI

optimized using Alpha beta pruning 

*runner.py file was given by CS50
